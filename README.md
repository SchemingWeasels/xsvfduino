# xsvfduino
An Arduino as an XSVF player to program CPLD's and FPGA's based on a reference implementation by Xilinx.

WARNING: This is working for me on an STM32 Arduino clone (the blue pill), but it will sure take a lot of effort to make it into a decent tool. I used the bluepill because it was lying on my benchtop and I had nothing better to lay my hands on. Use it at your own risk and don't blame me if it bricks your beloved CPLD/FPGA, or scares your dog, etc.
